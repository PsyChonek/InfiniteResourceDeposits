# InfiniteResourceDeposits

## Description
The InfiniteResourceDeposits Mod for Factorio allows players to continue mining a small amount of ore even after an entire ore patch has been depleted. This ensures that your mining operations can continue indefinitely, providing a steady, albeit reduced, supply of resources.

## Features
- Replace resources larger that 15k with infinite resources

## Usage
1. Start a new game or load an existing save.
2. Mine any ore patch as usual.
3. Once the ore patch is depleted, a small amount of infinite ore will remain, allowing you to continue mining indefinitely.

**Note:** Infinite ore generation is only available in new saves created after installing the mod. In existing saves, infinite ore will only appear in newly created chunks.

## Compatibility
This mod is compatible with Factorio version 2.0.0 and later. It is not compatible with any other mods that modify the resource generation system. Only supports vanilla ores.
